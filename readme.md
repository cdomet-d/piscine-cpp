## Compiling:

- Use C++ compiler with -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror flags.
- Code should compile with -std=c++98 flag.

## Formatting and Naming:

- Directory structure: ex00, ex01, ...
- Class names: UpperCamelCase.
- File names: Match class names.
- Output messages: End with newline.
- Avoid Norminette-style coding, but write clean, readable code.

## Allowed/Forbidden:

- Use standard C++ library, but avoid *printf(), *alloc(), and free().
- No external libraries (C++11, Boost).
- No using namespace or friend keywords (unless explicitly allowed).
- No STL containers or algorithms before Module 08 and 09.

## Design Requirements:

- Avoid memory leaks.
- Use Orthodox Canonical Form for classes (except when specified otherwise).
- Function implementations must be in .cpp files.
- Headers should be independently usable with include guards.

## General:

- Add additional files if needed.
- Pay attention to examples in guidelines.
- Read all modules before starting.
- Think critically and use your brain!

## Glossary
### Overhead (and runtime overhead)
- Overhead is the ressources needed to set up an operation. In computing, it refers to additional cost of resource usage incurred by certain implementation designs.
- Runtime overhead is overhead occuring as the program is running.

### Object-Oriented Programming

- **Class** : User-defined type encapsulating data and methods
- **Object** : Instance of a class
- **Constructor** : Special method called when object is created
- **Destructor** : Special method called when object is destroyed
- **Inheritance** : Mechanism for deriving new classes from existing classes
- **Polymorphism** : Ability of objects to take multiple forms
- **Encapsulation** : Hiding internal object details
- **Virtual Method** : Method that can be overridden in derived classes
