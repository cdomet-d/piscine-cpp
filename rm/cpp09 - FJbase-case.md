## A general description

The Ford Johnson algorithm is the fever dream of some mathematicians who wants to sort a serie of numbers with as little comparisons as possible. It is (painfully) described at pages 184 to 187 of [this horrible book](https://seriouscomputerist.atariverse.com/media/pdf/book/Art%20of%20Computer%20Programming%20-%20Volume%203%20(Sorting%20&%20Searching).pdf).

Further reading about this can be found [here](assets/FJA-initial-publication.pdf) and [here](https://www.academia.edu/94889884/Significant_improvements_to_the_Ford_Johnson_algorithm_for_sorting).

Essentially, there are three main steps to the Ford-Johnson Algorithm: making pairs, sorting pairs, and merging pairs.

> Now would be a good moment to determine how you want to hold your elements. I personnally used a vector of vectors and a deque of deques, because I found it easier to visualize than holding my input in a simple vector.

**Warning**: this is my understanding of the FJA. I might have entirely missed the mark on what we should be doing. Please see this as an explanation of my work, not as a tutorial.

## Grouping elements

The first step of the Ford-Johnson is to form pairs of `elemSize` elements, sorting each on their larger value.

> Nb: elemSize starts at 1, and then progresses by ^ 2 as long as a pair elements of elemSize can be formed.

```text
Input = 20 9 0 16 4 8 1 5 17 12 6 14 10 3 13 11
ElemSize = 1;
```

Right now, we are forming pairs of 1 elements, those so the largest value is on the "right hand side" of the pair.

For instance, in our input, the first pair is `20 | 9`. Since `20 > 9`, we swap those values. The pair becomes `9 | 20`. And here we are, having formed our very first pair !

This is our input before the first iteration:

```text
20
09
00
16
04
08
01
05
17
12
06
14
10
03
13
11
```

And this is what the input looks like once we're finished forming pairs of `1` elements:

```text
  9   20
  0   16 
  4    8 
  1    5 
 12   17 
  6   14 
  3   10 
 11   13 
```

What matters is that each element *within* the pair is sorted.

Let's now talk about the `a` & `b`.

Each element within a pair `i` is either a `a` or a `b`.

```text
 i   [ b] [ a]
[0]  [ 9   20] // pair 0 where b0 = 9 and a0 = 20
[1]  [ 0   16] // pair 1 where b1 = 0 and a1 = 16
[2]  [ 4    8] // pair 2 where b2 = 4 and a2 =  8
[3]  [ 1    5] // etc...
[4]  [12   17] 
[5]  [ 6   14]
[6]  [ 3   10]
[7]  [11   13]
```

Since we sorted the elements within the pair to ensure that the largest element is on the *right hand side*, this allows us to draw the following [general rule](assets/secret-tool.jpg):

```math
b_i < a_i
```

```text
00 16
09 20
01 05
04 08
06 14
12 17
03 10
11 13
```

`ElemSize *= 2;`

ElemSize = 4;
> Each element has four numbers

```text
00 16 09 20
01 05 04 08
06 14 12 17
03 10 11 13
```

sortEachElem:
> sort each element on the "max" of its element.

```text
01 05 04 08
00 16 09 20
03 10 11 13
06 14 12 17
```

`ElemSize *= 2;`

ElemSize = 8;
> Each element has eight numbers

```text
01 05 04 08 00 16 09 20
03 10 11 13 06 14 12 17
```

sortEachElem:
> sort each element on the "max" of its element.

```text
03 10 11 13 06 14 12 17
01 05 04 08 00 16 09 20
```

`ElemSize *= 2;`

ElemSize = 16;
> Each element has sixteen numbers

```text
03 10 11 13 06 14 12 17
01 05 04 08 00 16 09 20
```

Cannot form any more pairs:
> exit recursion and start the opposite process

## Inserting elements

`ElemSize /= 2;`

ElemSize = 8;
> Each element has eight numbers

```text
b0 | 03 10 11 13 01 04 12 17
a0 | 01 05 04 08 00 16 09 20
```

> We only have two elements, `b0` and `a0` > they can stay like this because they are already sorted on their max.

`ElemSize /= 2;`

ElemSize = 4;
> Each element has four numbers

```text
0 | b0 | 03 10 11 13 
1 | a0 | 01 04 12 17
2 | b1 | 01 05 04 08 
3 | a1 | 00 16 09 20
```

> We have more than two elements: they need to be sorted.
>
> In another data structure, we put `b0` and every `a`.

```text
Structure main;
vector<int> sisterIndex;

main[0] = 03 10 11 13 // b0
main[1] = 01 04 12 17 // a0
main[2] = 00 16 09 20 // a1

sisterIndex[0] = 2 (a1 is at index 2 of main);

// b1 | 01 05 04 08 remains to be placed
```

## Determining the range in which we perform binary search

- When putting the `a`s in main, keep track of the index of each of them so when the times comes to insert the bs we know where their sisters are in main.
- We aim to insert the current b in the range [0 - index of its sister `a` pair].

The issue is: how do we keep track of where the sister pairs are in main ?

The idea is to create a new vector called `sisterIndex` that will store the indexes of the `a`s in main.

The rules are as follow:

- For the index of each `b` in pend, we can recover at the same index in `sisterIndex` the index of the associated `a` in main.
- we keep track of only a1 and after, since a0 and b0 are placed together.

## Example

Given the following setting:

```cpp
arr[0] : {03 06 08 07}
arr[1] : {02 10 05 20}
arr[2] : {04 09 01 25}
arr[3] : {12 27 11 30}
```

We create the following main and pend:

```cpp
main[0] : 03 06 (b0)
main[1] : 08 07 (a0)
main[2] : 05 20 (a1)
main[3] : 01 25 (a2)
main[4] : 11 30 (a3)

pend[0] : 02 10 (b1)
pend[1] : 04 09 (b2)
pend[2] : 12 27 (b3)
```

We create `sisterIndex` and initialize it as we insert the `a`s in main.
Let's track the current indexes of the `a`s in `main` in a vector called `sisterIndex`.
We get the following values:

```cpp
sisIndex[0] = 2 (a1); // a1 is at index 2 of main
sisIndex[1] = 3 (a2); // a2 is a index 3 of main
sisIndex[2] = 4 (a3); // etc...
```

This side by side comparison confirms that using the index in pend of the `b` we want to insert allows use to find the index of its sister pair, hence determining the maximum range of our binary search.

```cpp
sisIndex[0] = 2 (a1); // a1 is at index 2 of main   pend[0] : 02 10 (b1)
sisIndex[1] = 3 (a2); // a2 is a index 3 of main   pend[1] : 04 09 (b2)
sisIndex[2] = 4 (a3); // etc...        pend[2] : 12 27 (b3)
```

For instance, using Jacobstahl numbers, let's try to insert `b3`, which is at `pend[2]`.

```cpp
static size_t getInsertionRange(indexOfB) {
 return sisterIndex[indexOfB]; // sisterIndex[2] == 4;
}

size_t indexOfCurrentB = 2; // because our current b is at pend[2]
size_t rangeMax = getInsertionRange(indexOfCurrentB);
```

So we will try to insert b between 0 and 4 in the main. Knowing that our range is always from the start of the main (0) to but excluding the index of the `a` sister pair, our range is [0 - 3];

Lets do it:

```cpp
size_t i = median of range [0 - 3];
for (/* b is not inserted*/)
 if (maxOfB(currentB) > maxOfA[i])
  newRange = median of [i - 3];
 else
  newRange = median of [0 - i];
```

`b3`s place is before `main[4]`, so we insert `pend[2]` at `main[4]`. The new `main` is:

```cpp
/* before */          /* after */
main[0] : 03 06 (b0)        main[0] : 3 6 (b0)
main[1] : 08 07 (a0)        main[1] : 8 7 (a0)
main[2] : 05 20 (a1)        main[2] : 5 20 (a1)
main[3] : 01 25 (a2) /* b3 > maxA2 && b3 < maxA3 */ main[3] : 1 25 (a2)
main[4] : 11 30 (a3)        main[4] : 12 27 (b3)
             main[5] : 11 30 (a3)
```

Our `sisterIndex` array is invalidated, so we must update it.

Using the index at which we just inserted our element (which is `4`, in this example), we find its value in sisterIndex:

```cpp
// three is at sisterIndex[1].
for (auto it = sisIndex.find(4); it != sisIndex.end(); ++it)
{
 *it++;
}
```

After updating sisIndex & comparing it with main, we see that the `a`s indexes are correct once more:

```cpp
    main[0] : 3 6 (b0)
    main[1] : 8 7 (a0)
	sisIndex[0] = 2 (a1);  main[2] : 5 20 (a1)
	sisIndex[1] = 3 (a2);  main[3] : 1 25 (a2)
    main[4] : 12 27 (b3)
	sisIndex[2] = 5 (a3);  main[5] : 11 30 (a3)
```

# Inserting using Jacobstahl numbers

in that [StackExchange post](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/116367/ford-johnson-merge-insertion-sort), we learn that:

> Making the best of binary search
>
> To perform a minimal number of comparisons, we need to take into account the following observation about binary search: the maximal number of comparisons needed to perform a binary search on a sorted sequence is the same when the number of elements is 2n and when it is 2n+1âˆ’1. For example, looking for an element in a sorted sequence of 8 or 15 elements requires the same number of comparisons.

> Many insertion-based sorting algorithms perform binary searches to find where to insert elements, but most of them don't take that property of binary search into account.


Basically, we want to take advantage of the fact that the worst case for binary search increases when its lenghts increases from a power of two to another. For instance, the worst case for an array of size 8 will remain the same until the lenght of the array becomes 16.

Inserting numbers using Jacobstahl sequence allows us to
